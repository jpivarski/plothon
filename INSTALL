		  Plothon installation instructions
========================================================================

==== Run the setup.py script. ==========================================

If you have access to your Python distribution (as root superuser or
because you installed Python yourself), just run

% python setup.py install

(without the '%' command prompt).  If you need to install Plothon in
your home directory, use this option:

% python setup.py install --home=~

(or replace '~' with the directory of choice).  This latter option
creates a `lib/python' directory for local Python modules.

For more on Python distutils, see http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html

==== Make sure Python can find your library. ===========================

If you installed your library in the standard location (no --home
switch), Python should be able to find it automatically.  Test it with

% python
Python 2.4.3 (#2, Oct  6 2006, 07:52:30) 
[GCC 4.0.3 (Ubuntu 4.0.3-1ubuntu5)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import plothon

(There should be no error messages.)

If you installed it in a different location (e.g. --home=~), find the
library by hand,

% ls -d ~/lib/python/plothon

and add this path to your PYTHONPATH variable.  In your login script,
add something like

export PYTHONPATH=~/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH

or

setenv PYTHONPATH ~/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH

(You might not be allowed to use the '~' shortcut.)
